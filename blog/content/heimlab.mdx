## What is it?

[Heimlab](https://heimlab.ferez.cloud)

A home server powered by Docker that hosts a personal cloud ecosystem — running services like file storage, media streaming, password management, and monitoring tools — all containerized for easy management and scalability. It turns your local machine into a private, self-hosted cloud where you control your data, automate your workflows, and experiment with modern infrastructure technologies.
