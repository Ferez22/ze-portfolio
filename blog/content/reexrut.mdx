## Must Haves

To set the perfect tone for your game night, you’ll need:

- **Snacks & Drinks** – Popcorn, chips, finger food, and a mix of cocktails or mocktails.
- **Music** – A good Spotify playlist sets the mood. Try _“Game Night Vibes”_ or _“Friends & Fun”_.
- **Lighting** – Soft lights or a few candles instantly make the atmosphere cozy.
- **Apps** – Keep things digital with apps like **Houseparty**, **Psych!**, or **Heads Up!** for quick laughs.

## Non-Alcoholic Game Ideas

A game night doesn’t need alcohol to be fun — it’s all about the energy!

- **Werewolf (a.k.a. Mafia)** – A storytelling bluffing game where villagers try to find the werewolves before they’re all eliminated. The tension and drama are half the fun!
- **Spyfall / Spy** – Everyone gets a role at a secret location, except one person — the spy — who must blend in by guessing where everyone is. Perfect for quick rounds and clever banter.
- **Mister White** – Similar to Spyfall, but with a twist: one person is “Mister White” and has to guess a secret word without ever hearing it.
- **Charades** or **Heads Up!** – Classic guessing games that never get old.
- **Jackbox Games** – If you’ve got a TV and smartphones, you’re set. Try _Fibbage_ or _Drawful_ for endless laughter.

- **Most Likely To** – Everyone points to who’s “most likely” to do something crazy — the one with the most fingers pointed takes a sip.

Would you like me to make it slightly more **playful and blog-style conversational** (like something for a lifestyle website), or keep it **clean and structured** (like your current style)?
